## Description
RABBIT-MAC-CHANGER is a powerful MAC address spoofer tool designed for penetration testers and cybersecurity enthusiasts. This tool allows users to change their MAC address easily using a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).

## Features
- **Random MAC Address Generator**
- **Custom MAC Address Input**
- **Restore Original MAC Address** (Works best in CLI, GUI is still in development)
- **Easy-to-Use GUI** (Still in development, some features may not work consistently)
- **CLI Version Works Perfectly Without Errors** (üî• Highly recommended)

## Legal Warning
This tool is intended for **educational and ethical** purposes only. **Using it for unauthorized network access is illegal.** The creator is **not responsible for any misuse.**

## Fun Uses (Dont use it for inlegall activities)
- Get unlimited airport WiFi sessions 
- Bypass MAC-based authentication restrictions
- Enhance anonymity while testing networks

## Dark Side
While MAC spoofing can be used for legitimate security testing, attackers may misuse it for illegal activities such as bypassing network restrictions or impersonating devices.

## Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **If you change your MAC with this tool, it will NOT restore back without restarting your OS.**
- **Use it on VirtualBox only to avoid network conflicts.**
- **If the MAC address changes in the display, it has been successfully changed. If it does not change in the display, then it has not changed.**
- **If the GUI version has issues, close and reopen the app or use the CLI version for a smoother experience.** (üî• Highly recommended!)

## Installation & Usage
```bash
# Run the CLI version (Recommended for stability)
sudo python3 mac_changer.py

# Run the GUI version (Still in development, may have bugs)
sudo python3 mac_changer_gui.py
```
important Notes:

This tool is in development, and some bugs may still exist.(use cli version is best because it has no bugs and errors)

The MAC address will change according to the display output. If the MAC is updated in the display, the change has successfully taken effect. If not, the MAC address has not changed.

If you close the application and reopen it, the tool will work again.

once the mac changes it will not restore again until you restart the os (restore button has bug) 

use this gui tool only on virtual box if you are using cli you can directly run it has no bugs or error(it has all functions perfectly)

CLI version works better than the GUI and functions without errors. (IMPORTANT: The CLI version is more stable!)
